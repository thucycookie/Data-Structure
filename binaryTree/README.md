IndexNode.java and IndexTree.java are used to build a dictionary that contains all the words and their counts from a text file.

The idea of a BinarySearchTree is implemented. All the found words are put in alphabetical order. Each word represents a node in the tree and each node contains the count of how many time a word has appeared.
